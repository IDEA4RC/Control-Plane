## Requirements

This deployment uses a kuberntes cluster and the recomended amount of resources is 4 CPUs and 16GB of RAM for the Istio deployment to run smoothly.

## Step-by-step Deployment


After downloading Istio procced with:

Install Istio and enable injection in the datamesh ns

```shell
istioctl install --set profile=demo -y 

```
Set up a namespace to ensure the encapsulation of the services with mTLS. It also set the Istio sidecar injection automatically
```shell
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/base/001_datamesh-ns.yaml
```
Now we enforce the mTLS policy along the namespace we just created and we create the Istio Gateway resource pointing to localhost for local development 

```shell 
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/base/002_mtls-policy.yaml

kubectl apply -f kubernetes/base/003_gateway.yaml
```

## Clean up

Follow the steps to clean up

```bash
kubectl delete -f ./kubernetes

istioctl uninstall --purge -y

kubectl delete namespace istio-system
```
